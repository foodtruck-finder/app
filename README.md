# Final Project - Foodtruck Finder

Portland Code Fellows 301

Going forward we are merging our branches into the 'working' branch.

We will use the working branch to test our changes as a team before we merge working into master.
Thus, master will always be functional, hopefully bug-free, and presentation-ready!
To see the latest-greatest, just bring up your console and type:

git pull origin working

Then checkout your local 'working' branch:

git checkout working

Load it up in your browser/editor to have a look! Keep in mind that the working branch is what we as a team are proposing to merge into master at some point in the future -- once we are sure it's stable. This should take some of the anxiety out of making/merging a pull request!

Note: This is easy to do, but also easy to forget. When you submit a pull request just be sure that your 'base' branch dropdown is set to 'working' and not 'master'.--Jade Dhabolt
